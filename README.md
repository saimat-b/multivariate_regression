In this Jupyter Notebook I will be exploring Marketing Dataset. The data contains the sales data for two consecutive years of a particular product of some brand.(both are unknown). Each row contains the Volume of Sales for a week and different campaigning information or various promotion methods for that product information for each week for two consecutive years.
    
**Obejctive:** To establish relationships between Sales Volume and other parameters of the product using multivariate regression.
